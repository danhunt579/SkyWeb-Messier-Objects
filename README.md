# SkyWeb-Messier-Objects
Shows correct use of html background image and radial gradient as body background

This was a fun procjet to do because not only did it cement the proper usage of background and radial gradients but the content was about astronomy and objects that you can find in the night sky.  Messier was an astronmer from the 1700s who was the first to catalouge a lot of the elements in the sky.

The page body background apart from the entire html doucument, creatively uses white opaque radial gradients positioned at 4 different locations to generate a celestial feel effect. The overall html background image is fixed so that is doesen't scroll with the rest of the content giving the page a modern feel.  Many elements also use drop-shadows, box-shadows or text-shadows to give the page a depth of perception.
